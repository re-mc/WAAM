# WAAM
*What An Adventure Modpack*

To use the modpack, it is recommended to use MultiMC, downloaded from here: https://multimc.org/#Download
It is also recommended to get the modpack from modrinth instead of here. Pack on modrinth: https://modrinth.com/modpack/waam

With each update, there'll be a mods.zip file, and a waam.zip file. waam.zip is the modpack, and mods.zip is just the mods (for updating)
